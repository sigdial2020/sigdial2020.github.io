  abstract  = {In this paper we present the newest version of retico - a python-based incremental dialogue framework to create state-of-the-art spoken dialogue systems and simulations. Retico provides a range of incremental modules that are based on services like Google ASR, Google TTS and Rasa NLU. Incremental networks can be created either in code or with a graphical user interface. In this demo we present three use cases that are implemented in retico: a spoken translation tool that translates speech in real-time, a conversation simulation that models turn-taking and a spoken dialogue restaurant information service.},
