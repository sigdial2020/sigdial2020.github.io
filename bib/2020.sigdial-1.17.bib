  abstract  = {Spoken interaction with a physical robot requires a dialogue system that is modular, multimodal, distributive, incremental and temporally aligned. In this demo paper, we make significant contributions towards fulfilling these requirements by expanding upon the ReTiCo incremental framework. We outline the incremental and multimodal modules and how their computation can be distributed. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our robot-ready spoken dialogue system to be integrated with almost any robot.},
